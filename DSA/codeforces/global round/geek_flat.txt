Left linear grammer
In a grammer if all productions are in the form A->Ba or A->a , where A,B are non-terminal symbols and a is a terminal symbol.
Example- A->Aa|Bb|b

Right linear grammer
In a grammer if all the productions are in the form A->aA or A->a, where A,B are non-terminal symbols and 'a' is terminal symbol.
Example- A->aA|bB|b

Conversion of left linear grammer to right linear grammer:

1. Find reverse of Context free grammer
2. Create Finite automata of grammer from step one
3. Then take reverse of the Finite Automata and that will be our final output
4. Start State: It will be the first production's state
5. Final State: consider those states which end up with input alphabets. 

6. Write the production as the output followed by the state on which the transition is going
7. At the last add Îµ because that's is required to end the derivation

The given grammer	A -> Ba/Ab/b    
					B -> Ca/Bb
					C -> Aa/Cb


Step 1:		A -> aB/bA/b
			B -> aC/bB
			C -> aA/bC/a
Step 2:   flat1 yha

Step 3:		flat2 yha

Step 4: Given step(4 and 5) show only the intial and final states.

Step 6: A->bA/aC
		B-> bB/aA
		C-> aB/aC

Step 7:ADD epsilon to the last step at C
		 A->bA/aC
		B-> bB/aA
		C-> aB/aC/

(2) Conversion of right linear grammer to left linear:

1. Start from the first production
2. then for every left alphabet go to symbol followed by it
3. Start State: The first production's state
4. Final State: Those states which end with a terminal symbol
5. Take reverse of the finite automata
6. Then write right linear grammar  by putting the terminal symbol in right of every production
7. Then take reverse of the right linear grammar
8. you will get the final left linear grammar


The given grammer: A -> aB/bA/b
				   B -> aC/bB
			       C -> aA/bC/a

In Step 1 and Step 2 we draw the diagram flat1.png

Step 3 and 4 describes the initial and final states.
